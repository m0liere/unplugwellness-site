# Unplug Wellness — Astro Website

A modern, high-performance web presence for **Unplug Wellness**, built with a focus on speed, aesthetics, and secure infrastructure. This project serves as both a business platform and a showcase of cutting-edge AI-assisted development workflows.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build/) (Static Site Generation for maximum performance)
* **UI Library:** React / Tailwind CSS
* **Components:** Radix UI & Framer Motion (for accessible, smooth interactions)
* **Forms:** Web3Forms API with secure Environment Variable integration
* **Deployment:** Netlify (CI/CD via GitHub)

## 🤖 AI-Driven Development Workflow

* **v0 (Vercel):** Utilized for initial UI/UX generation and rapid prototyping of the design system and layout components.
* **Cursor:** Used as the primary IDE to refine the TypeScript logic, manage the project structure, and handle complex component interactions.
* **Gemini (Google):** Served as the Lead Architect/Thought Partner for infrastructure decisions, DNS management, secure API handling, and deployment strategy.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Security

* **DNS Management:** Domain transferred to Namecheap with custom BasicDNS configuration to support professional email aliasing (`hello@unplugwellness.com`).
* **Security:** Sensitive API keys (Web3Forms) are managed via environment variables to ensure zero-exposure in public source control.
* **Performance:** Achieved near-perfect Lighthouse scores by leveraging Astro's "islands architecture" and asset optimization.
